## Components

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Server-side rendered React application
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Rich text editor for blog posts
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- 90s grunge theme implementation

### Backend Services

#### API Gateway
- Express.js based REST API
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- CORS configuration

#### Database
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- Database schema with proper indexing
- Data backup and recovery procedures

#### Security Infrastructure
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting
- Security headers
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

#### Monitoring & Logging
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- Alert management
- Performance monitoring

### DevOps Infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing
- Blue-green deployment
- Backup procedures

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. API validates credentials
3. JWT token generated
4. Token stored in Redis
5. Token returned to client

### Blog Post Creation Flow
1. User submits post
2. Request validated
3. Media processed and stored
4. Database updated
5. Cache invalidated
6. Notifications sent

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection
- Data encryption at rest
- TLS/SSL encryption in transit
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Containerized services
- Load balancing
- Database replication
- Cache distribution

### Performance Optimization
- CDN integration
- Response caching
- Database query optimization
- Asset optimization

## Disaster Recovery
- Automated backups
- Multi-region deployment
- Failover procedures
- Data retention policies

## Monitoring & Alerting
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Custom alert thresholds
- Incident response procedures
