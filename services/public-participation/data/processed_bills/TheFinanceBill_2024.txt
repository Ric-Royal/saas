Section 18 of Cap 470 which it is proposed to amend- 

18. Ascertainment of gains or profits of business in relation to certain 

nonresident persons 

(1)  Where  a  non-resident  person  carries  on  any  business  in  Kenya 
which  consists  of  manufacturing,  growing,  mining,  or  producing,  or 
harvesting,  whether  from  the  land  or  from  the  water,  any  product  or 
produce, and sells outside, or for delivery outside Kenya, such product or 
produce,  whether  or  not  the  contract  of  sale  is  made  within  or  without 
Kenya,  or  utilizes  that  product  or  produce  in  any  business  carried  on  by 
him outside Kenya, then the gains or profit from such business carried on 
in  Kenya  shall  be  deemed  to  be  income  derived  from  Kenya  and  to  be 
gains  or  profits  such  amount  as  would  have  accrued  if  such  product  or 
produce had been sold wholesale to the best advantage. 

(2)  Where  a  bank  which  is  a  permanent  establishment  of  a  non-
resident  person  holds  outside  Kenya  any  deposits,  assets  or  property 
acquired from its operations in Kenya, the gains or profits accruing from 
such deposits, assets or other property held outside Kenya shall be deemed 
to be income accrued in or derived from Kenya. 

(3)  Where  a  non-resident  person  carries  on  business  with  a  related 
resident person and the course of such business is such that it produces to 
the  resident  person  or  through  its  permanent  establishment  either  no 
profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to accrue 
from that business if there had been no such relationship, then the gains or 
profits  of  such  resident  person  or  through  its  permanent  establishment 
from such business shall be deemed to be of such an amount as might have 
been expected to accrue if the course of that business had been conducted 
by independent persons dealing at arm’s length. 

(4)  For  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  gains  or  profits  of  any 
business carried on in Kenya no deductions shall be allowed in respect of 
any  expenditure  incurred  outside  Kenya  by  a  non-resident  person  other 
than  expenditure  in  respect  of  which  the  Commissioner  determines  that 
adequate  consideration  has  been  given;  and,  in  particular,  no  deduction 
shall be allowed in respect of expenditure— 

(a)  on  remuneration  for  services  rendered  by  the  non-resident 
directors  (other  than  whole-time  service  directors)  of  a  non-
resident company the directors whereof have a controlling interest 
therein,  in  excess  of  five  per  cent  of  the  total  income  of  such 
company, calculated before the deduction of such expenditure, or 
of  twenty-five  thousand  shillings,  whichever  is  the  greater,  so, 
however,  that  in  no  case  shall  a  deduction  in  excess  of  one 
hundred and fifty thousand shillings shall be allowed;

permanent  establishment  shall  be  ascertained  without  any  deduction  in 
respect  of  interest,  royalties  or  management  or  professional  fees  paid  or 
purported  to  be  paid  by  the  permanent  establishment  to  the  non-resident 
person and by disregarding any foreign exchange loss or gain with respect 
to  net  assets  or  liabilities  purportedly  established  between  the  permanent 
establishment in Kenya and the non-resident person. 

Provided  that  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the  expression  "non-
resident person" shall include both the head office and other offices 
of the non-resident person.

if— 

(a) either person participates directly or indirectly in the management,
