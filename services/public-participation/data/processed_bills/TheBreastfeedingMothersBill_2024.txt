Statement  of  the  Obj ects  and  Reasons  for  the  Bill

The  principal  obj ect  of  this  Bill  is  to  provide  a  legal  f r am ew o rk  o n

mothers  who  may  wish  to  breastfeed  their  children  at  the  work  place.

The  Bil l  provides  for  the  right  of  a  mother  to  breastfeed  freely  or
express  milk  for  her  infant .  The  Bill  further  requires  employers  to  provide
 b r e a st f e e d  o r
breastfeeding  employees  with  lactation  rooms  to  either
express  their  milk  for  their  children.

 b i rt h  and  i t

Breastfeeding  is  the  f irst  preventive  health  measure  that  can  be  given
to  a  ch i ld  at
 relationship.  It  is
nature’s  f irst  immunization,  enabling  the  inf ant  to  fight  potential  serious
infection  and  it  contains  growth  factors  that  enhance  t h e  m a t u r a t i o n  o f
 a n
infant ’s  organ  systems.

 al so  enh ances  m o ther -i n f an t

Kenya  is  a  signatory  to  treaties  that  provide  for  the  right  of  an  infant
 sh o u l d
to  exclusive  breastfeeding  for
 six  months.
therefore  promote  and  encourage  breastfeeding  and  provide  the  specific
 t o
measures  that
continue  expressing  their  mi lk  and  breastfeeding  their  infant  or  young
child.  Furthermore,  the  practice  of  breastfeeding  may  save  the  country ’ s

Presently ,  female  employees  exit  the  work  force  or  stop  breastfeeding
in  order  to  secure  their  j ob  security .  No  woman  should  be  f o rced  to
compromise  the  health  of  her  child  in  order  to  make  a  living.

right  to  freely  breast  feed  or  express  one’s  milk  for  the  baby .  It  also  places
an  obligation  on  the  employers  to  provide  breastfeeding  working  mothers
with  rooms  to  either  breastfeed  or  express  their  milk .  It  also  provides  for
the  standards  of  such  rooms.  The  Bi ll  further  provides  for  baby  changing
tables.  This  is  important  because  the  greater  maj ority  (public)  fi nds  it
unsanitary  to  change  a  baby  in  a  publ ic  setting  such  a s  a  r e st a u r a n t .  T h i s
