County  Gover nments’  Equitable  Share

4.  The  Bill  proposes  to  allocate  county  governments  K Sh .
 39 1 .1
billion  for  the  financial  year  2024/25  as  equitable  share  of  revenue  rai sed
nationally,  which  is  an  increase  from  a  base  of  KSh.  37 4 .5  b i l l i on
allocated  in  the  financial  year  2023/24.

resources  for  the  personnel  emoluments  relating  to  the  library  services
transferred  from  the  Kenya National  Library  Services  i n  F Y  2022/23  to
the  county  governments.

6.  The RMFL,  which  was initially  a conditional  allocation to  county
governments  for  maintenance  of  county  roads,  was folded  up  to  be  part  of
county  governments equitable share in FY  2021/22. However,  th e  n ati o n al
and  county  governments  coordinating  Summit  meeting  hel d  o n  10 th  -
12th  February,  2023  resolved  that  RMFL  allocation  to  co u nt i es  sh al l
 b e
considered in FY  2024/25 through a restructured process. Further  to  this,  a
consensus  has  been  built  that  attendant  resources  for  RM FL  be  transf erred
to county governments as conditional  allocations beginning F Y  20 24 / 2 5 .

7.  Taking  into  account  these  policy  developments,  the  equitable
share  base  has  been  revised  from  KSh.  385.4  billion  al located  to  counties
m  FY  2023/24,  by  netting  off  KSh.  10.9  billion  related  to  R M F L  to  K Sh

 The  DORB,  2024  has  proposed  an  allocation  of  Kshs.  2 ,549  1

 The  proposed  county  governments’

 equitable  revenue  sh ar e

allocation  of  KSh.  391.1 billion  is  informed  by  the  following  f actors:

(a)  Trends  in  the  performance  of

consideration  in  determining  the  K Sh.
equitable  share  of  revenue  in  FY 2024/25);

 revenue  (this  was  tak en  i nto

(b)  Increased  expenditures  for  National  Government  for  purposes  of
 servicing  coupled  with  a  weakening  shilling  against  t h e

debt
dol lar;

(c)  The  Government  commitment  to  implement  a  fiscal  c o n so l i d a t i o n
plan  targeting  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  to  3.9  percent  of  GDP  in
FY  2024/25.  This  is  designed  to  slow  down  accumulation  o f
public  debt;

(d)  Financing  constraints  due  to  limited  access  to  f i n an ce  i n  t he

domestic  and  international  f inancial  m arkets;

(e)  L ow  ordinary  revenue  collections  attributed  to  the  ongoing
geopol itical  shocks.  This  incl udes  the  Russia-Ukraine  w a r  a n d  t h e
US  Federal  Reserve’s  interest  rate  hike  which  has  negatively
affected  the  dollar  exchange  rate  against  the  Kenya  shi lling  and
the  internat ional  debt  market ;  and

(f )  The  National  Government  continues  to  solely  bear  sh o r t f a l l s  i n

allocation  for  the  financial  year  2024/25  was  derived  from  the  Di vision  of
Revenue Act,  2023.  This base line is informed  by  costing  of  expenditure

basis for  equitable  share over  the years.

informed by  the following assumptions:

(i)

 The  Equalization  Fund  arrears  will

 be  financed  f ro m  the

(iii)  That

 there  will

 be  no  major  economic  shocks  that

negatively  affect  revenue  collection.

(iv)  The  government  will  mobilize  enough  resources  f r o m  the

domestic  market  to  finance  the  deficit,

(v)  Depreciation of  the shilling against  the dollar  w i l l  stab i l i ze ,
(vi)  Counties  will  continue  to  enhance  their  own  sources  o f

to  promote  economic  growth  at  the  local  levels.

31.  The  proposals  contained  in  the  Bill  take  into  account  th e  f i sc al
