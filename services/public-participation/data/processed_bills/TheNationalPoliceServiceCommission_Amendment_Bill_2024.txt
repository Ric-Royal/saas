The Bill  recogmses that  m the execution of  their  tasks, police  of ficers

safety  of  others  In  some  cases,  due  to  the  unique  challenges  of  policing,
they  inflict  harm  on  human  beings  as  police  work  is  m o re  str essf ul
 th an
 H eal t h

Taskforce  Report  of  2020  have  examined  the  Germane  aspect  of  mental
health,  but  have  overlooked  the  mental  health  of  police  o f fi cer s
 T h e
proposed  Bill  therefore  gives  the  National  Police  Service  C o m m i ssi o n
