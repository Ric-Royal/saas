In  order

 government

 the  national

 to  ensure  that

 and  county
governments  are  able  to  perform  assigned  functions,  as  w el l  as  en su r e  th e
National  Government  is  able  to  provide  requisite  resources  to  address  the
critical  expenditures,  the  National  Treasury  proposes  that  both  l evel s  of
government  bear  tbi§  shortfall  equitably  by  reducing  the  equitable  share
to  county  governments  by  K Sh.  204 2  biUion  which  translates  to  5 ,81
per cent  pf  the  proj ected  K Sh.  346.00  deviation  in  proj ected  sharable
r e v e n u e :

The National  Government  on  its part  will  bear  a  significantly  higher
share  of  the  shortf all  amounting  to  K Sh .  325.88  billion ,  or  94.19  per cent
of  the  proj ected  shortfall  of  K Sh.  346.00.  The  shortfall  will  be  offset  by
expenditure  reduction  by  putting  in  place  austerity  m e a s u r e s ,
Consequently,  it’s  expected  that  county  govern ments  sh ou l d  al so  rev i se
their  budgets  downwards  to  ref lect  the  shortfalls  and  comply  with  the
r ev i sed  sch ed u l e .
